We were able to identify the answers for above mentioned questions. Here is statistical summaary of the same: 

The customer who spends the most : C10574,the amount of spend : 49039.57
Number of less risky customers : 488
Number of risky customers : 3812

To get the list of the customers, we will have to run the script. I have included a requirements.txt file to replicate the results.
